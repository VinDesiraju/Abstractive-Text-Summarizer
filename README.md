# Abstractive Text Summarization 

## Overview

This is an abstractive summarization model implemented using encoder decoder architecture including self attention mechanisms on inshorts news dataset containing news headlines and articles.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NLTK library (`nltk`)
- Google Colab (for the provided Google Drive integration)

## Execution
Upload the ipynb file and dataset to Google Colab and run all cells.

Rouge score is calculated. Results can be improved by changing the hyperparameters (increasing epochs and layers) i.e by performing more training which would require more computing power.
